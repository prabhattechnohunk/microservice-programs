###
server.port is a way to define a value for the tomcat port of your service.
 It is used in "application.properties" file. If you do not fix this property, the port 8080 is chosen by default.

local.server.port is used to recover the value of the actual running port(not always from application.properties.I
if u run different instance at different port it will give you that port no)

#
 An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through
  functionality built into the operating system or microservice.
  #
  Ideally, application.properties contains all common properties which are accessible for all environments
   and environment related properties only works on specifies environment.
